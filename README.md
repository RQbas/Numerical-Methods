Here I will share projects for numerical methods.

Differential Equations Runge Kutta
  Program approximating solution of differential equation returning points
of function.

Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial
  Program calculating coefficients of polynomials from given nodes, this
time it uses Lagrange method.

System of Linear Equations Seidel
  Program calculating approximated values of solution in iterative way.
With starting points defined by user (usually starting point is 0)

Numerical Integration  â€¦
  Program calculating approximated definite integrals using 2 methods:
Chebyshev and Newton-Cotes. Additionally for different degrees of
interpolating approximation (n=0,1,2,4). Program requires defined
interval in Integration_Calc.java and defined function in function.java.

Polynomial - least root interval
  Program determining least interval in which roots of polynomial are
contained with defined accuracy. (Visual Studio)

Value of Polynomial
  Program calculating value of polynomial for user defined argument
(standard method + horner method), also displays time of calculations in
ms.

System of Linear Equations Cramer
  Program calculating solution for system of linear equations with defined
by user coefficients.

Newton Polynomial
  Program generating interpolation polynomial from given nodes using newton 
method.
  
Numerical Differentiation Backward
    Program calculates value of derivatives obtained by formula also calculates 
exact value of derivative (derivative implemented in source code) and having these 
values it derives analytical&relative error for range 1 of argument with step defined 
by user. At the end of the output program displays maximum errors for such range of arguments.
(n stands for number of components in formula -> better accuracy).

System of Linear Equations Gauss
  Program calculating solution for system of linear equations with defined
by user coefficients using Gauss elimination method.
